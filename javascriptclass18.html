        * #JustInTime many modern browser use JIT compilation to improve performance. here, the engine translate, the code from #AST into machine code, A language, the computer understand directly for faster education.
        * run the JS codefaster 
        * make the code run with HTML
        * #MakingThingsHappen Engine starts executing the court line by line according to the #AST. it can interact with the webpage structure ( Document Object Model or DOM) to manipulate elements, respond to user action ( #Events ) and perform calculations.</h1>
